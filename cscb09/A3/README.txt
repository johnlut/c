In a system where files are meant to be edited and changed, using a hard link would have both files be permanently in sync even when the user may not want that. For example, if instead of making a new file a hard link way made, and the file in the new location was then edited. A user who would like to restore an older version of the file who went back to the original directory would find the exact same file. This would effectively ruin the purpose of the program.
